/* Efficient data structure choices in JavaScript are crucial for optimizing performance. Here's a breakdown of common data structures and their use cases:

1. Arrays:
Description: Ordered collections of elements, accessed by index.
Use Cases: Suitable for storing lists of items, especially when you need to access elements by their position.
Efficiency: Fast random access (O(1) time), but insertions and deletions at the beginning or middle can be slow (O(n) time).

2. Objects:
Description: Collections of key-value pairs, where keys are strings.
Use Cases: Ideal for representing data with named properties.
Efficiency: Fast lookups, insertions, and deletions by key (average O(1) time).

3. Maps:
Description: Similar to objects, but keys can be of any data type.
Use Cases: Useful when you need to use non-string keys or preserve the order of insertion.
Efficiency: Fast lookups, insertions, and deletions (average O(1) time).

4. Sets:
Description: Collections of unique values.
Use Cases: Efficient for checking if a value exists and removing duplicates.
Efficiency: Fast lookups, insertions, and deletions (average O(1) time).

5. Linked Lists:
Description: Dynamic collections where elements are linked together.
Use Cases: Useful for implementing queues and stacks.
Efficiency: Efficient insertions and deletions (O(1) time) at the beginning and end, but slower random access (O(n) time).

6. Stacks:
Description: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
Use Cases: Used in function call stacks, undo/redo mechanisms.
Efficiency: Fast push and pop operations (O(1) time).

7. Queues:
Description: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
Use Cases: Used in task scheduling, message queues.
Efficiency: Fast enqueue and dequeue operations (O(1) time).

8. Trees:
Description: Hierarchical data structures with nodes and edges.
Use Cases: Used in file systems, decision trees, and searching algorithms.
Efficiency: Searching, insertion, and deletion can be efficient for balanced trees (O(log n) time).

9. Graphs:
Description: Non-linear structures that represent relationships between entities.
Use Cases: Used in social networks, maps, and network routing.
Efficiency: Depends on the graph representation and algorithm used.

10. Hash Tables:
Description: Data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to locations in an array.
Use Cases: Efficient for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.
Efficiency: Average O(1) time complexity for these operations.

11. Typed Arrays:
Description: Array-like objects that provide a mechanism for accessing raw binary data.
Use Cases: Useful for manipulating graphics data, audio, and other binary data.
Efficiency: Can improve performance for specific operations on numerical data.

Choosing the Right Data Structure:
The best data structure depends on the specific problem you're trying to solve. Consider factors such as:
Time complexity: How long operations take as the data size grows.
Space efficiency: How much memory the data structure uses.
Required operations: What types of operations do you need to perform (e.g., searching, insertion, deletion, random access)?
By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure, you can make informed decisions to optimize your JavaScript code. */
